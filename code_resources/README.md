# Learn Objective-C in 24 Days - Code

This repo contains code examples references in the [*Learn Objective-C in 24 Days*](../blog_posts/38.md) series of articles. Each folder contains the code of a particular article, though not each post has downloadable code examples. See the index below for a guide on which folder belongs to which chapter. If you're viewing this in GitHub Pages, the "Folder" links will not work. Using a local file viewer, or the GitHub file viewer should work to open to the folder locations.
